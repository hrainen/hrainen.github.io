            <h1>Voxel Engine  | Of Noise and Grids</h1>
          </div>
          <p>
              Feeling much better since yesterday, I managed to make more progress on the voxel rendering.
              Now my program not only renders multiple chunks, but I also applied
              <em> Perlin </em> Noise to the chunks and made a simple but crude green material to give chunks that terrain look.
              This worked, but needs tuning.
          </p>

              <br>
              Continuing from where I left off with yesterday’s blog, I refactored my code to render multiple chunks.
          </p>

          <p>
              <br>
            	However, as you can see in the second picture, currently I am rendering
              the side of chunks when they will never be seen. I will add logic to check neighboring chunks in the next couple updates.
          </p>

          <p>
            	Shortly after getting multiple chunks rendering, I set out to apply Perlin Noise to chunks.
              It works by generating a grid of values between 0 and 1. Then starting from the bottom layer of a given chunk,
              loop through every block and if the corresponding noise value at that index is within a threshold,
              that block is solid.
          </p>

          <p>
              Every layer I go up the chunk will increase the threshold
              for what constitutes a filled in block, meaning every subsequent layer
              has fewer and fewer solid blocks.
          </p>

          <p>
              <br>
            	However, this did not work as well as I had hoped. I was expecting that it would be much smoother,
              and Unity’s built in <em> Perlin </em> Noise didn’t have any parameters to change.
          </p>

          <p>
          	  Thankfully I figured out my problem. When I generated my grid of noise values,
              I used the index of the grid as the input to the noise function (multiplied by a constant).
              However, that value was much too big, making the resulting steps in the Noise function regress into
              pure random noise. Reducing the step a couple times
              smoothed out the values and gave the chunks that characteristic landscape look.
          </p>

          <p>
              <br>
            	One final problem that I tackled was that at the edge of each chunk,
              there is usually a hard edge. I believe this is caused by using the position of
              the chunk as the input to the noise function ( an annoying mistake I repeated several times in my code )
              and ( hopefully ) resolved it by multiplying by a small constant, eg. .03.
          </p>

          <p>
            	Hopefully this fixes the weird transitions at the edge of chunks,
              but I’ll have to generate more chunks to really test it out.
              Also, I haven’t rendered more than a row of chunks because I want to make a system that scales infinitely.
              I’ll likely implement both that and rendering columns of chunks by the end of the week.
          </p>
